# Docker Selenium Pi

The project is thanks to the great work by [SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium).

Original ported from [Docker Selenium release 3.4.0 Einsteinium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium/releases/tag/3.4.0-einsteinium).

Currently a limited port to include a StandaloneChrome (Chromium Browser) version that runs on the Raspberry Pi 2.
